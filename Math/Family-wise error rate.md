Hochberg & Tamhane (1987) defined "family" as "any collection of inferences for which it is meaningful to take into account some combined measure of error".

Let $H_1, \ldots, H_m$ denote the $m$ hypothesis, and let $m_0$ denote the number of true null hypothesis. 

> [!defn] 
> FWER is the probability of making at least one type I error in the family.
> $$FWER = \mathbb{P}(V\geq 1) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(V = 0)$$
