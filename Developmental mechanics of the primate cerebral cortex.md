# Objective
- Growth in the brain is constrained by physics at each point in time.
- What mechanical forces are involved in:
	- relative and absolute thickness of convolutions
	- the trajectories of cortical projections

## Cortical Convolutions
- Degree of folding
	- Measured by average "wavelength" of convolutions
		- Shorter wavelength = more folding

- What affects specific placement, orientation, and characteristic shape of convolutions?
	- Formation of convolutions may depend on the specific organization of long-range projections
		- spatial arrangement of cortical regions through the minimization of the axonal tension of interlinking fibers would lead to a reduction of cortical wire and volume
		- characteristic shape of cortical convolutions results from  global minimization of axonal viscoelastic tension most axonal trajectories in the adult cortex  should be straight, particularly when dense.
			- we determined trajectories and relative densities of prefrontal cortical  projections in rhesus monkeys
			- All projection sites and labeled neurons in prefrontal cortex collected via retrograde tracer injection.
			- Slice the brain into 50 um sections
			- Classify projections into straight, intermediate or curved.
			- straight projections were significantly denser, and there was a significant increase of individual projection densities from curved to intermediate to straight trajectories.
		- Evidence of minimizing tension = more straight trajectories

## Relative and absolute laminar thickness
- gyral convolutions of the cerebral cortex are thicker than sulcal ones
- if a mechanical impact on laminar cortical thickness could also be demonstrated analytically
- The metric thickness of cortical layers (compartmentalized into layers I, II+III, IV, and V+VI) in 21 prefrontal areas was measured from coronal sections, and relative laminar thickness values were calculated for all layers by dividing the absolute thickness of each layer by the total cortical thickness.
- greater absolute thickness of gyri was specifically due to an increase in the thickness of the deep layers
- Since the density of deep cortical layers is relatively invariant across gyral, straight and sulcal regions (Dombrowski et al. 2001), the increased thickness of deep gyral layers also indicated an increase of the total number of neurons in these layers

## reason for the significantly greater number of neurons in deep gyral layers?
Developmental studies indicate that  the ‘inside-out’ formation of cortical layers by radial migration partly overlaps with the folding of the cortical sheet. 

- Basically, convolutions form and cells migrate from the deep to superficial layer.
	- But they are subject to mechanical forces
	- In gyri, the tangential forces compress intermediate layers -> increase vertical resistance -> larger cell density in deep layers + thicker layer
	- In sulci, the opposite occur. 
- in turn, should result in a  higher number of cells, and greater cortical thickness, in the more strongly curved convolutions.

## Neuronal morphology and function
Mechanical impact of folding changes shape of cell bodies and dendrites.
- Since gyri have thicker cortical layers, the 
- Even though the depicted neurons reside in the same cortical region and in the same layer, somata and arbors of neurons in the deep layers of gyri are clearly stretched radially (Fig. 3b). In contrast, neuronal somata in the deep sulcal layers are compressed tangentially and their apical dendrites are wavy (Fig. 3d).
