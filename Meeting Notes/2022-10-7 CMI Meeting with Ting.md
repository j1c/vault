Ting:
- interested in new imaging techniques
- study neurodevelopment of humans

Current project:
- Compare human and macaque brains
- What brain functions are remained in macaque and humans
- Current method: using anatomy to match regions across species

Embedding method
- Main diagonals are functional connectomes
- off diagonals are similarity matrix of nodes from humans and macaques

What we want:
- Use [[graph matching]] on functional connectomes to get find similarity of nodes between macaque and humans
